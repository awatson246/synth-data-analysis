A pipeline to analyze synthetic time-series data quality using common fidelity and utility metrics.

Initially built off of this electric power consumption dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/electric-power-consumption

Data is generated using both TimeGAN (https://github.com/benearnthof/TimeGAN) and DoppelGANger (https://github.com/fjxmlzn/DoppelGANger).
